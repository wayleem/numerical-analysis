# Root Finding Techniques

You need a C compiler to run the code.

## Bisection Method

Run `gcc -o out/bisection-method bisection-method.c test-functions.c -lm` and `out/bisection-method` to see the output of the program. The bisection method found the root in 15 steps.

## Newton Method

Run `gcc -o out/newton-method newton-method.c test-functions.c -lm` and `out/newton-method` to see the output of the program. The bisection method found the root in 4 steps.

## Secant Method

Run `gcc -o out/secant-method secant-method.c test-functions.c -lm` and `out/secant-method` to see the output of the program. The bisection method found the root in 5 steps.

## Fixed Point Iterations

Run `gcc -o out/fixed-point-iterations fixed-point-iterations.c test-functions.c -lm` and `out/bisection-method` to see the output of the program. The bisection method found the root in 8 steps.

## Example Problem

Run `gcc -o out/example-problem example-problem.c test-functions.c -lm` and `out/example-problem` to see the output of the program. The bisection method found the root in 20 steps.
